# Delete empty cards only if they are new
## Rationale
I do not like to delete cards. If some cards where reviewed and no
longer exists, it is probably a sign that I made something wrong. When
I correct this error, those empty cards will still be here with their
review history. Great ! 

However, I sometime create thoushands of new cards by accident, when I
edit a card type. I want to be able to delete those card.

The tradeoff I found is deleting cards only when they are new.
If, sometime, I find and empty card, already seen, and it's not a
mistake, I just have to suspend it, and everything is all right.
## Usage
From main window, select "Tools">"Empty new cards". It acts similarly
to "Empty cards".
