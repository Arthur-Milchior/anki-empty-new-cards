Gives an option to delete empty cards which are also new.

#Rationale
I do not like to delete cards. If some cards where reviewed and no longer exists, it is probably a sign that I made something wrong.
However, I sometime create thoushands of new cards by accident, when I edit a card type. And I want to delete those cards without deleted the one viewed at least once.
Hence, this add-on.
